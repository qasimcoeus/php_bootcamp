# php_bootcamp
- Checkout this repo using 'git clone'
- Install VirtualBox
- Install Vagrant
- Run 'vagrant up' and grab a coffee as the setup might take around 10 minutes.

Hit http://localhost:8080/bootcamp

The VM consists of the following packages:
- php 5.5
- mysql 5.5
- Apache 
- Adminer for mysql
- Code Sniffer

## Why we need it?
Vagrant is an engineering miracle. It helps us create cross platform development environment as quicky as a single command.

This VM is for the developers who want to setup Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP environment quickly. The average time to setup this VM is about 10 minutes. If you install the components included in this VM manually, it may take between 1 to 4 hours. I personally use it to setup php based frameworks, e.g. Drupal, Magento, WP etc.
